Classification focuses on estimating the relationship between the independent variables (x) and the dependent (y), **categorical variable**.\n","\n","In this lesson, we'll focus on a classification technique called **logistic regression**. While a **linear regression** model outputs a real number as the label, a **logistic regression** model outputs a probability value.

Unlike in linear regression, where the output can be any real value, in **logistic regression** the output has to be a real value between **0** and **1**, since the output represents a probability value.

**testing_probs** represents an origin we just need to choose the one with the largest probability. We can use the Dataframe method [idxmax()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.idxmax.html) to return a Series where each value corresponds to the column or where the maximum value occurs for that observation.
